      <h3>Graphical User Interface.</h3>
    </div>
    <p>There are a variety of graphical user interface (GUI) programs, for example: Desktop Application, Smart Phone
      Application. A GUI allows a computer user to move from application to application. A good GUI makes an application
      easy,practical, and efficient to use, and the market place success of today's software programs depends on good
      GUI design.</p>

    <p>Simply put, a graphical user interface is a easy way to communicate what you want to a computer application (or
      computer operating system) using graphical symbols. GUIs let you work with picture-like items (icons and arrows
      for example) to tell the computer what you want from it. And, rather than a keyboard (which can leave you guessing
      what to type next), you get to scoot around a blocky thing on your desk called a mouse, which makes the arrows and
      icons scoot around on the screen.</p>

    <p>In simple terms. a good GUI program can make people's work efficiency is greatly improved.</p>
